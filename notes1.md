### What is Exploratory Data Analysis

• Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyze the datasets to summarize their main
characteristics in form of visual methods.
• EDA is nothing but a data exploration technique to understand various aspects of the data.
• The main aim of EDA is to obtain confidence in a data to an extent where we are ready to
engage a machine learning model.
• EDA is important to analyze the data it’s a first steps in data analysis process.
• EDA give a basic idea to understand the data and make sense of the data to figure out the
question you need to ask and find out the best way to manipulate the dataset to get the
answer to your question.
• Exploratory data analysis help us to finding the errors, discovering data, mapping out data
structure, finding out anomalies.
• Exploratory data analysis is important for business process because we are preparing
dataset for deep thorough analysis that will detect you business problem.
• EDA help to build a quick and dirty model, or a baseline model, which can serve as a
comparison against later models that you will build.

## Steps involved in EDA
1. Data Sourcing
2. Data Cleaning
3. Categorical Analysis
4. Numerical Analysis
5. Derived Matrixcs

# Data Sourcing
> Data Sourcing is the process of gathering data from multiple sources as external or internal data collection.
• There are two major kind of data which can be classified according to the source:
1. Public data
2. Private data

`Public Data`
--> The data which is easy to access without taking
any permission from the agencies is called public
data. The agencies made the data public for the
purpose of the research,
> Example: government and other public sector or ecommerce sites made the data public.

`Private Data`
--> Private Data:- The data which is not available on
public platform and to access the data we have to
take the permission of organisation is called
private data.
> Example: Banking ,telecom ,retail sector are there which not made their data publicly available. 


# Data Cleaning 
After collecting the data , the next step is data
cleaning. Data cleaning means that you get rid of
any information that doesn’t need to be there and
clean up by mistake.
Data Cleaning is the process of clean the data to
improve the quality of the data for further data
analysis and building a machine learning model.
The benefit of data cleaning is that all the incorrect
and irrelevant data is gone, and we get the good
quality of data which will help in improving the
accuracy of our machine learning model. 

Steps
1. Handle missing values
2. Standardization of the data
3. Outlier Treatment
4. Handle invalid values
