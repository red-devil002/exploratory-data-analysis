# Methods of Feature Scaling
1. Standard Scaler
-> Standard scaler ensures that for each
feature, the mean is zero and the
standard deviation is 1, bringing all
feature to the same magnitude. In
simple words Standardization helps you
to scale down your feature based on
the standard normal distribution

2. Min-Max Scaler
-> Normalization helps you to scale down
your features between a range 0 to 1
